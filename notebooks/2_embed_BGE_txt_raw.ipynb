Making payments every month and staying below your credit limit\\nshows creditors you can manage your money and stick to payment deadlines.\\n\\nHere are some tips to help you build your credit:\\n\\n###  Pay on time  \\n\\nA late credit card payment can hurt your payment history and credit rating,\\nespecially if it’s a pattern. Plus, you’ll have to pay interest on the balance\\nand other late fees.\\n\\n###  Schedule your payments  \\n\\nIf you have trouble remembering to pay your credit card bill, set up scheduled\\npayments from your chequing account to your credit card every month. Make sure\\nyou have enough funds in your account to cover the amount due.\\n\\n###  Pay in full  \\n\\nPaying just the minimum balance will keep your account in good standing but it\\nwon’t save you on interest fees.

Did you know there are unique advantages to\\nhaving multiple credit cards? Learn the benefits of choosing to get cards with\\ndifferent credit card limits or features.\\n\\n* * *\\n##  Budget help\\n\\nHaving multiple credit cards gives you the ability to designate cards for\\ncertain kinds of purchases, making tracking your spending easier.\\n\\n  * If you run a small business, you may choose one card to use exclusively for business expenses. Keeping your professional and personal finances separate could save you the hassle of sorting through your credit card statements at tax time. \\n  * If you make frequent work-related purchases as an employee, it could also prevent you from having to submit expense reports to your employer that contain your personal transactions. \\n\\n##  \\nOnline purchases\\n\\nUsing just one card for online purchases can help protect your identity by\\nlimiting the potential exposure of your personal information. Having all your\\nonline transactions on one billing statement can also make it easier for you\\nto recognize fraudulent activity and quickly put a stop to it.\\n\\n##  \\nEmergencies\\n\\nThere are 2 ways to take advantage of a backup credit card:\\n\\n  * Carry it with you in your wallet, particularly if you are travelling, in case your primary card is denied. \\n  * Ensure you will still have access to credit if your wallet is lost or stolen by keeping a card at home. \\n\\n##  \\nExplore credit card offers from CIBC\\n\\nCIBC has several types of credit cards, including those with cash back and\\ntravel rewards programs.

If you have temporary residence status, your application may take longer to review \\n  * You must be the age of majority — 18 or 19, depending on the province you live in \\n  * You have a good credit score \\n  * You haven’t filed for bankruptcy in the past 7 years \\n  * You meet the minimum annual income requirement \\n\\nHow to apply for a credit card\\n\\nYou can apply for a credit card in one of 3 ways:\\n\\n  * Online:  Once you’ve found the credit card you like, select the “Apply Now” button to start the application process. \\n  * Over the phone:  Call one of our customer care representative at  1-866-525-8622  Opens your phone app. \\n  * In person:  Visit a CIBC Banking Centre near you  Opens in a new window. \\n\\n* * *\\n##  How to speed up the application process\\n\\nTo speed up the application process, fill out your application form correctly\\nwith all the necessary information. Apply for cards that match your credit\\nprofile.\\n\\nHere are some more tips to consider:\\n\\n###  Check your credit score\\n\\nBefore you apply, check your credit score. If it’s not where it should be, you\\ncan request a copy of your credit report to understand the factors that have\\naffected your score. If you have a poor credit score, you may have a harder\\ntime getting approved for a card. But we can help you make a plan and take\\nproactive steps to bring your score up.\\n\\n###  Lower your credit utilization ratio\\n\\nYour credit utilization rate is the amount of available credit you use at any\\ntime — it’s  also an important factor in determining your credit score. A high\\nutilization rate may indicate you’ll have a hard time paying off your card\\nbalance on time, so a lower utilization rate is better for your credit score.\\nYou should aim to have a credit utilization ratio of  30%  or less. Anything\\nhigher can damage your credit score. Not using your card enough can also\\naffect your credit score because lenders won’t be able to measure your\\ncreditworthiness.\\n\\n###  Reduce outstanding debt\\n\\nIf you’re carrying a lot of debt, you may have a hard time getting approved\\nfor a credit card. To creditors, high balances mean you’re at risk of\\ndefaulting on your new credit card balances. It may be a good idea to reduce\\nyour outstanding debt, especially if you have a lot of it, before you apply.\\n\\n###  Find out if you prequalify for a card\\n\\nIf you prequalify for a credit card, this usually means your credit score and\\nother financial information matches some of the initial eligibility criteria\\nto open a card. Getting prequalified doesn't guarantee an approval but it does\\nimprove your chances. Most prequalification offers will appear in your online\\nor mobile banking, or you might get a letter in the mail. To learn more about\\nwhether or not you prequalify for a card, call us anytime at  1-866-525-8622\\nOpens your phone app.  .\\n\\n* * *\\n##  How does my credit score impact the credit card application process?\\n\\nYour credit score is an indicator of your credit risk. Your credit risk shows\\nhow likely you are to make your credit card payments on time.\\n\\nA strong credit score can improve your chances of getting approved for a\\ncredit card because it shows creditors you can use your credit card\\nresponsibly. Having a low credit score means you might be approved for a\\ncredit card, but with a lower credit limit.\\n\\nYour credit history directly impacts your credit score. Your credit history\\nincludes a record of transactions, and lists the types of credit you  have —\\nlike  credit cards or loans. Your credit history will also show your payment\\nhistory, including your on-time payments, late payments or missed payments.\\n\\nLearn more about your credit score and ways to raise it  .\\n\\n* * *\\n##  What should I do if my application is denied?\\n\\nBeing denied for a credit card can be frustrating, but it doesn’t mean you’ll\\nnever qualify for a credit card again.\\n\\nHere’s what you can do after your credit card application is denied:\\n\\n###  1\\\\. Understand why you were denied\\n\\nYou’ll get a letter stating the reason why your credit card application was\\ndenied. This could be related to your credit report or credit score. If you’ve\\nmissed payments, have debt or tend to carry a high credit card balance, you\\nmay have a tough time getting approved for a credit card. You could also be\\ndenied for forgetting to fill out important information in your application or\\nif you don’t meet all the eligibility requirements.\\n\\n###  2\\\\. Review your credit report\\n\\nIf your credit report was a factor in the application decision, review your\\nreport. If you find mistakes, you can dispute them with the credit bureau.\\n\\n###  3\\\\. Try to fix the problem\\n\\nIf your credit score is low, take a few months to build it up. Use your credit\\ncard responsibly, make your payments on time and try to pay off the entire\\nbalance each month so you’re not charged interest. Good credit habits will\\nhelp you get approved on your next application. Plus, make sure you meet the\\neligibility  requirements — like  you’re the age of majority and your income\\nmeets the threshold.\\n\\n###  4\\\\. Wait before you apply again\\n\\nIf you were denied for a card, don’t start applying for other cards right away\\nbecause this could negatively impact your credit score. Wait until you know\\nwhy you were denied and start making positive changes to improve your chances\\nof being approved for the next card. When you’re ready to apply, go for a\\ncredit card that fits your credit profile.\\n\\nRead more about credit cards  More articles about C I B C credit cards\\n\\n* * *\\nTools and advice\\n\\n  * Credit Card selector \\n  * Your credit score and your credit card \\n\\n* * *\\n##  Get started\\n\\nApply online  for a C I B C credit card\\n\\nCall us:  1-866-525-8622  Opens your phone app.\\n\\nFind a Banking Centre  opens in a new tab in your browser\\n\\n\",\n",

To that end, you may be debating whether to\\napply for a business or personal credit card for purchases in your business’\\nearly days. There are pros and cons to both, and the right solution for your\\nbusiness depends on your particular needs. Compare the various business and\\npersonal credit card features to determine which route is right for you.\\n\\n* * *\\n##  ** Using business credit cards for your small business expenses  **\\n\\nBusiness credit cards are designed for businesses as small as a sole\\nproprietorship up to businesses of 20 people or less.\\n\\nGenerally, it’s a wise decision to use a separate business card for work\\nexpenses rather than a personal card. Here’s why:\\n\\n  * **It keeps your personal finances separate.** When it comes to paying your statement, you’ll have to separate which expenses were personal and which were business-related in order to keep your budgets intact. You’ll also have to do this at tax time.   \\n\\n  * **You’re eligible for small business perks.** Choosing a business card can get you better deals on interest rates and maybe even higher credit limits. You can also find cards that reward you with points.   \\n\\n  * **You can get additional cards for your employees.** Rather than deal with expense reports, give your employees credit cards to use for work-related expenses.    \\n\\n##  ** Using personal credit cards for business expenses  **\\n\\nIn some cases, small business owners may opt to use personal credit cards for\\ntheir business expenses. This may also be necessary at the very beginning as\\nyour business may not be well enough established to qualify for a business\\ncredit card.\\n\\nOne benefit of using a personal credit card for business expenses is that you\\nmay be able to accrue rewards for all of your purchases.

Making payments every month and staying below your credit limit\\nshows creditors you can manage your money and stick to payment deadlines.\\n\\nHere are some tips to help you build your credit:\\n\\n###  Pay on time  \\n\\nA late credit card payment can hurt your payment history and credit rating,\\nespecially if it’s a pattern. Plus, you’ll have to pay interest on the balance\\nand other late fees.\\n\\n###  Schedule your payments  \\n\\nIf you have trouble remembering to pay your credit card bill, set up scheduled\\npayments from your chequing account to your credit card every month. Make sure\\nyou have enough funds in your account to cover the amount due.\\n\\n###  Pay in full  \\n\\nPaying just the minimum balance will keep your account in good standing but it\\nwon’t save you on interest fees. Plus, carrying a balance each month means\\nyou’ll be in debt longer. Try not to spend more than you can afford to repay,\\nand stick to a budget.\\n\\n###  Don’t go over your limit  \\n\\nGoing over your credit limit can lower your credit score, so try not to use\\nall of your available credit at once.\\n\\n###  Check your credit report often  \\n\\nReview your credit report and score regularly for mistakes or unauthorized\\nactivity. If you notice any issues, report them right away.\\n\\n###  Assess your financial situation  \\n\\nIf you don’t have a regular source of income or enough money in the bank to\\ncover your credit card bills, a credit card may not be right for you —\\nconsider a debit or a prepaid card instead.\\n\\n##  Still not sure which card is right for you?\\n\\nExplore all cards\\n\\n##  Have questions?\\n\\nMeet with us  Opens a new tab in your browser\\n\\nCall us:  1-800-385-2582  Opens your phone app.\\n\\nFind a Banking Centre  Opens a new window in your browser.\\n\\n\\n```',\n",

Use our compare tool to narrow down your\\noptions  .\\n\\n* * *\\n##  How to qualify for a credit card\\n\\nHere are some of the basic requirements you need to meet when applying for a\\ncredit card:\\n\\n  * You must be a Canadian citizen or resident. If you have temporary residence status, your application may take longer to review \\n  * You must be the age of majority — 18 or 19, depending on the province you live in \\n  * You have a good credit score \\n  * You haven’t filed for bankruptcy in the past 7 years \\n  * You meet the minimum annual income requirement \\n\\nHow to apply for a credit card\\n\\nYou can apply for a credit card in one of 3 ways:\\n\\n  * Online:  Once you’ve found the credit card you like, select the “Apply Now” button to start the application process. \\n  * Over the phone:  Call one of our customer care representative at  1-866-525-8622  Opens your phone app. \\n  * In person:  Visit a CIBC Banking Centre near you  Opens in a new window. \\n\\n* * *\\n##  How to speed up the application process\\n\\nTo speed up the application process, fill out your application form correctly\\nwith all the necessary information. Apply for cards that match your credit\\nprofile.\\n\\nHere are some more tips to consider:\\n\\n###  Check your credit score\\n\\nBefore you apply, check your credit score. If it’s not where it should be, you\\ncan request a copy of your credit report to understand the factors that have\\naffected your score. If you have a poor credit score, you may have a harder\\ntime getting approved for a card. But we can help you make a plan and take\\nproactive steps to bring your score up.\\n\\n###  Lower your credit utilization ratio\\n\\nYour credit utilization rate is the amount of available credit you use at any\\ntime — it’s  also an important factor in determining your credit score. A high\\nutilization rate may indicate you’ll have a hard time paying off your card\\nbalance on time, so a lower utilization rate is better for your credit score.\\nYou should aim to have a credit utilization ratio of  30%  or less. Anything\\nhigher can damage your credit score. Not using your card enough can also\\naffect your credit score because lenders won’t be able to measure your\\ncreditworthiness.\\n\\n###  Reduce outstanding debt\\n\\nIf you’re carrying a lot of debt, you may have a hard time getting approved\\nfor a credit card. To creditors, high balances mean you’re at risk of\\ndefaulting on your new credit card balances. It may be a good idea to reduce\\nyour outstanding debt, especially if you have a lot of it, before you apply.\\n\\n###  Find out if you prequalify for a card\\n\\nIf you prequalify for a credit card, this usually means your credit score and\\nother financial information matches some of the initial eligibility criteria\\nto open a card. Getting prequalified doesn't guarantee an approval but it does\\nimprove your chances. Most prequalification offers will appear in your online\\nor mobile banking, or you might get a letter in the mail. To learn more about\\nwhether or not you prequalify for a card, call us anytime at  1-866-525-8622\\nOpens your phone app.  .\\n\\n* * *\\n##  How does my credit score impact the credit card application process?\\n\\nYour credit score is an indicator of your credit risk. Your credit risk shows\\nhow likely you are to make your credit card payments on time.\\n\\nA strong credit score can improve your chances of getting approved for a\\ncredit card because it shows creditors you can use your credit card\\nresponsibly. Having a low credit score means you might be approved for a\\ncredit card, but with a lower credit limit.\\n\\nYour credit history directly impacts your credit score. Your credit history\\nincludes a record of transactions, and lists the types of credit you  have —\\nlike  credit cards or loans. Your credit history will also show your payment\\nhistory, including your on-time payments, late payments or missed payments.\\n\\nLearn more about your credit score and ways to raise it  .\\n\\n* * *\\n##  What should I do if my application is denied?\\n\\nBeing denied for a credit card can be frustrating, but it doesn’t mean you’ll\\nnever qualify for a credit card again.\\n\\nHere’s what you can do after your credit card application is denied:\\n\\n###  1\\\\. Understand why you were denied\\n\\nYou’ll get a letter stating the reason why your credit card application was\\ndenied. This could be related to your credit report or credit score. If you’ve\\nmissed payments, have debt or tend to carry a high credit card balance, you\\nmay have a tough time getting approved for a credit card. You could also be\\ndenied for forgetting to fill out important information in your application or\\nif you don’t meet all the eligibility requirements.\\n\\n###  2\\\\. Review your credit report\\n\\nIf your credit report was a factor in the application decision, review your\\nreport. If you find mistakes, you can dispute them with the credit bureau.\\n\\n###  3\\\\. Try to fix the problem\\n\\nIf your credit score is low, take a few months to build it up. Use your credit\\ncard responsibly, make your payments on time and try to pay off the entire\\nbalance each month so you’re not charged interest. Good credit habits will\\nhelp you get approved on your next application. Plus, make sure you meet the\\neligibility  requirements — like  you’re the age of majority and your income\\nmeets the threshold.\\n\\n###  4\\\\. Wait before you apply again\\n\\nIf you were denied for a card, don’t start applying for other cards right away\\nbecause this could negatively impact your credit score. Wait until you know\\nwhy you were denied and start making positive changes to improve your chances\\nof being approved for the next card. When you’re ready to apply, go for a\\ncredit card that fits your credit profile.\\n\\nRead more about credit cards  More articles about C I B C credit cards\\n\\n* * *\\nTools and advice\\n\\n  * Credit Card selector \\n  * Your credit score and your credit card \\n\\n* * *\\n##  Get started\\n\\nApply online  for a C I B C credit card\\n\\nCall us:  1-866-525-8622  Opens your phone app.\\n\\nFind a Banking Centre  opens in a new tab in your browser\\n\\n\\n```\",\n",

To that end, you may be debating whether to\\napply for a business or personal credit card for purchases in your business’\\nearly days. There are pros and cons to both, and the right solution for your\\nbusiness depends on your particular needs. Compare the various business and\\npersonal credit card features to determine which route is right for you.\\n\\n* * *\\n##  ** Using business credit cards for your small business expenses  **\\n\\nBusiness credit cards are designed for businesses as small as a sole\\nproprietorship up to businesses of 20 people or less.\\n\\nGenerally, it’s a wise decision to use a separate business card for work\\nexpenses rather than a personal card. Here’s why:\\n\\n  * **It keeps your personal finances separate.** When it comes to paying your statement, you’ll have to separate which expenses were personal and which were business-related in order to keep your budgets intact. You’ll also have to do this at tax time.   \\n\\n  * **You’re eligible for small business perks.** Choosing a business card can get you better deals on interest rates and maybe even higher credit limits. You can also find cards that reward you with points.   \\n\\n  * **You can get additional cards for your employees.** Rather than deal with expense reports, give your employees credit cards to use for work-related expenses.    \\n\\n##  ** Using personal credit cards for business expenses  **\\n\\nIn some cases, small business owners may opt to use personal credit cards for\\ntheir business expenses. This may also be necessary at the very beginning as\\nyour business may not be well enough established to qualify for a business\\ncredit card.\\n\\nOne benefit of using a personal credit card for business expenses is that you\\nmay be able to accrue rewards for all of your purchases. Earning Aeroplan  ®\\npoints, Aventura  ®1  Points or PETRO-POINTS™ can come in handy if you’re\\ntravelling a lot to get your business off the ground.  \\n\\n##  ** Apply for credit cards with CIBC  **\\n\\nWhether you choose to use a business card or a personal card for your work\\nexpenses, you can apply for both with CIBC.
